# CLAB411

These are files for CLAB411 with Dr. Thomas Sommerfeld.

rac1.0.py is Dr. Sommerfeld's orignal, non-running code.

rac2.0.py is Dr. Sommerfeld's original code with the print statements corrected. This is code used to make sure new iterations are repoducing, at least, the same results as the old code.

rac.py & rac_utils.py is most up-to-date version of the running code.

rach.py & rach_utils.py are completely new code. The goal is to have better formulated code and to have it completely sourced with proper document strings.
